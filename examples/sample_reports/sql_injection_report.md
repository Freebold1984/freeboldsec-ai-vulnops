# HackerOne Vulnerability Report Template

## Summary
**[Vulnerability Type]** vulnerability discovered in **[Application/Domain]** that allows **[Impact Description]**.

**Severity:** High  
**Weakness:** CWE-89 (SQL Injection)  
**Domain:** target.example.com  

---

## Description

A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the search functionality of the application. The vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.

**Root Cause:** The application fails to validate and sanitize user input in the `query` parameter of the `/api/search` endpoint before incorporating it into database queries.

**Attack Vector:** An attacker can manipulate the search query to inject malicious SQL code, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database or extracting sensitive information.

---

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to `https://target.example.com/api/search`
2. Send a POST request with the following payload:
   ```json
   {
     "query": "' OR 1=1 --",
     "filters": {
       "category": "all"
     }
   }
   ```
3. Observe the database error message in the response
4. The error reveals the underlying SQL query structure and confirms the injection

## Proof of Concept

**Request:**
```http
POST /api/search HTTP/1.1
Host: target.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 67

{
  "query": "' OR 1=1 --",
  "filters": {
    "category": "all"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 512

<html>
<body>
  <h1>Database Error</h1>
  <p>You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '' OR 1=1 --' at line 1</p>
  <p>Query: SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%' OR 1=1 --%'</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Impact

### Confidentiality Impact: **High**
- Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database
- User credentials, personal information, and business data at risk
- Potential access to administrative accounts and privileges

### Integrity Impact: **High**  
- Database records can be modified or deleted
- Application logic can be bypassed
- Data corruption possible through malicious queries

### Availability Impact: **Medium**
- Database operations can be disrupted
- Potential for denial of service through resource-intensive queries
- Application functionality may become unavailable

### Business Impact
- **Data Breach Risk:** Customer PII and sensitive business data exposure
- **Compliance Violations:** Potential GDPR, CCPA, or industry-specific violations
- **Financial Impact:** Potential fines, legal costs, and reputation damage
- **Operational Disruption:** Database compromise could halt business operations

## Remediation

### Immediate Actions (Within 24-48 hours)
1. **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation for all search parameters
2. **WAF Rules:** Deploy Web Application Firewall rules to block common SQL injection patterns
3. **Error Handling:** Remove detailed database error messages from user-facing responses
4. **Monitoring:** Enable database query logging and anomaly detection

### Long-term Solutions (Within 30 days)
1. **Parameterized Queries:** Replace all dynamic SQL with parameterized queries/prepared statements
   ```python
   # Vulnerable code
   query = f"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%{user_input}%'"
   
   # Secure code
   query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE %s"
   cursor.execute(query, (f'%{user_input}%',))
   ```

2. **Database Permissions:** Implement principle of least privilege for database connections
3. **Code Review:** Conduct security code review for all database interactions
4. **Security Testing:** Implement automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Verification Steps
1. Test the same payload after remediation - should return generic error
2. Verify parameterized queries are used throughout the application
3. Confirm error messages no longer expose database structure
4. Validate input sanitization is working correctly

## Technical Details

**Database Type:** MySQL  
**Affected Parameter:** `query` in POST body  
**Injection Point:** Search functionality  
**SQL Query Pattern:** `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%[USER_INPUT]%'`

**Additional Vulnerable Endpoints:**
- `/api/users/search` - Similar vulnerable pattern
- `/api/products/filter` - Potentially vulnerable to similar attacks
